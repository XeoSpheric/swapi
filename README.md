# SWAPI

## The Star Wars API

Source code for [swapi.dev](https://swapi.dev)

## What happened to swapi.co?

Unfortunately swapi.co is not maintained anymore.

## What is swapi.dev?

An "unofficial" branch of "swapi", supported by @juriy.

## What is the goal?

The goal of this branch is to provide a React port of the front-end and move the backend to Rust.

## What is the timeline?

I am hoping to complete the front-end one week from the branch creation. After that is complete I will be starting the Rust port. If the rust port is successful, I am going to test out creating the front-end with one of the Rust frameworks.
