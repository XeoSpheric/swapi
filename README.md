# SWAPI

## The Star Wars API

Source code for [swapi.dev](https://swapi.dev)

## What happened to swapi.co?

Unfortunately swapi.co is not maintained anymore.

## What is swapi.dev?

An "unofficial" branch of "swapi", supported by @juriy.

## What is the goal?

The goal of this branch is to provide a React port the service (using the NextJS Framework).

## What is the timeline?

I am hoping to complete the front-end one week from the branch creation. After that is complete, my attention will be turned onto the api. That will start with an exact port of the services, then decide some future enhancements.
